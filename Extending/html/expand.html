<h1>Extending the Smart Citizen Kit</h1>

<h2>Pinout</h2>

<p>In order to add new features or just modify the code to transmit what you want, you shall know how the pins are ordered. The following table summarizes it all up.</p>

<p>| --------- | --------- |
| GND       | GND       |
| IO3 (10)  | IO2 (9)   |
| IO1 (13)  | IO0 (5)   |
| SCL       | SDA       |
| S5  (A1)  | S4  (A0)  |
| S3  (A3)  | S2  (A2)  |
| S1  (A5)  | S0  (A4)  |
| VBAT      | VBAT      |
| --------- | --------- |</p>

<h2>Making your own shield</h2>

<p>If you want to make your own shield from scratch and you use EAGLE PCB editor (or any compatible one) you should start by downloading our <em>Ambient Shield</em> template from <a href="http://#">here</a>.</p>

<h2>I2C pins</h2>

<p>I2C is a two-wire interface used to establish a communication between devices of any kind, developed by Philips in the mid-90s.</p>

<p>As you can see in the <em>Ambient Shield</em> there are two columns of pings, called <code>I2C_0</code> and <code>I2C_1</code>. Each one of this columns have the following pins which you can solder:
- <code>+5V</code>: power supply 
- <code>VBAT</code>: secondary power supply
- <code>SDA</code>: data line
- <code>SCL</code>: clock line
- <code>GND</code>: ground</p>

<p>With the help of this input/output pins you can connect any device that speaks I2C, even another Arduino!</p>
